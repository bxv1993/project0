            <p class="des">No one knows why Stegosaurus (which translates to "roof lizard") had such distinctive plates that on average were 2 feet tall and 2 feet wide, but that hasn't kept this tiny-brained dinosaur from holding a tight grip on the popular imagination. Some believe this dinosaur's spiky plates could have been brightly colored and could move, and the spikes on the tail may have actually been horizontal instead of vertical, which would help ward off predators. Thanks to its debut in "Jurassic Park" movies, theme parks, games, toys, and trading cards, this elephant-sized dinosaur from the late Jurassic period won the hearts of many as a peaceful plant-eater that roamed the plains in what is now North America.</p>
