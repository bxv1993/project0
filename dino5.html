            <p class="des">An up-and-comer on the dinosaur popularity charts, Spinosaurus, or spine lizard, was distinguished by its vast size (59 feet long) and likely weight of a couple of tons more than T. rex. It has a mysterious 5.5-foot sail on its backâ€”a fin-like fan that's purpose is richly debated. From the few fossils discovered in Egypt and Morocco, it is assumed that the Spinosaurus was mostly a fish-eating river dweller and perhaps one of the first dinosaurs that could swim. Although, its strong back legs have some believing it could run up to 15 mph.</p>
