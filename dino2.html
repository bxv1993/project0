            <p class="des">Probably the most instantly recognizable of all dinosaurs is the North American Triceratops (three-horned face), with its parrot-like beak and huge frill at the back of its head. It combined a gentle, plant-eating disposition with three fearsome-looking horns that were probably used both in courtship and keeping hungry tyrannosaurs and raptors at bay. This dinosaur is from the late Cretaceous period (68-66 million years ago), and the adults were big—about 26 feet long, 10 feet tall, and 12 tons. It's South Dakota's state fossil and Wyoming's official state dinosaur. It has held a spotlight in movies such as "Night at the Museum: The Secret of the Tomb," and was later shrunken considerably to promote the film as a freebie in fast-food meals for kids. A dinosaur room at any museum is an awesome place for dinosaur lovers, and the Triceratops gets lots of attention at New York City's American Museum of Natural History—you can see the evidence of an injury from perhaps a fight with another Triceratops on the fossil at this museum. And in Washington, D.C., at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, kids of all ages still can't wait to see the museum's beloved Hatcher, a favorite Triceratops specimen enjoyed in a complete form by crowds since 1905 until it fell apart 90 years later to be displayed as a T. rex meal.</p>
